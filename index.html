<span>&#8226;</span> Rising senior at the University of Maryland, College Park pursuing a double degree in mathematics and computer science <br>
<span>&#8226;</span> Interested in making software, breaking software, and making software to break software
<br><br>
Here is a non-exhaustive list of my current interests or fields I'd otherwise want to delve into:
<br><br>
<span>&#8226;</span> Offensive cybersecurity <br>
<span>&#8226;</span> Cryptography and cryptanalysis <br>
<span>&#8226;</span> Software exploitation and reverse engineering <br>
<span>&#8226;</span> Automated program analysis (via tools like SMT solvers) <br>
<span>&#8226;</span> Formal verification of programs and protocols <br>
<span>&#8226;</span> Mathematics, particularly in algebra (elliptic curves are cool) <br>
<span>&#8226;</span> Consensus algorithms and scalable blockchains <br>
<span>&#8226;</span> Cybersecurity-adjacent machine learning <br>
<span>&#8226;</span> Cybersecurity-adjacent software engineering <br>

<br><br>

I also believe strongly in open-sourcing my work (in fact, I believe every software engineer should strive to do so).<br><br>

Any questions? Feel free to contact me at x@y.z where x = pwang00, y = umd, z = edu.  But first, have you tried throwing <span id="joke">Hello World!</span> at it?

<script type="text/javascript">
  const jokes = ["a SAT solver", "Lattice Basis Reduction", "SageMath", "Ghidra", "gdb"];
  document.getElementById("joke").innerHTML = jokes[Math.floor(Math.random() * jokes.length)]
