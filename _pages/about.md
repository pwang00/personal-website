Hey everyone, I'm Philip.  I recently graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a double degree in mathematics and computer science, and I will be working as a software engineer at Amazon Web Services in Crystal City, VA.  

Previously, I interned at [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com), where I developed an Ansible [wrapper](https://github.com/trailofbits/mc-ansible) around the [Manticore](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore) symbolic executor and implemented an adversarial model inversion attack proof of concept for the [PrivacyRaven](https://github.com/trailofbits/PrivacyRaven) deep learning testing library.  I also interned at Raytheon CODEX, where I conducted vulnerability research against embedded systems.

I sometimes play capture the flags (CTFs) with [DiceGang](https://ctftime.org/team/109452/), though I've been kind of inactive lately.  I mostly focus on solving cryptography challenges, though I occasionally branch out into other categories.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in offensive cybersecurity and writing robust software.  Below is a non-exhaustive list of my current interests or fields I'd otherwise want to explore: 

* Cryptography and cryptanalysis
* Software exploitation and reverse engineering
* Automated program analysis and formal verification (via tools like SMT solvers)
* Mathematics, particularly in algebra (elliptic curves are cool)
* Consensus algorithms and scalable blockchains
* Cybersecurity-adjacent machine learning
* Cybersecurity-adjacent software engineering 
* Compilers (optimizations, infrastructure) 

I am a strong believer in open-sourcing my work, and I hope that every software engineer strives to do the same.

Besides doing security-related stuff, I have a few hobbies, some newer than others:

* Playing piano and listening to classical music: Chopin is probably my favorite composer, and his [Ballade No. 1 in G Minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW5po_Z7YEs) is my favorite composition
* Watching movies and TV series: my current favorite films are [The Shawshank Redemption](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/), [Oblivion](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483013/), and [Contratiempo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4857264/), and my favorite TV series is [Dark](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5753856/)
* Going out for jogs on cool days
* Flying drones and getting nice aerial shots
* Visiting new places and getting to know people
